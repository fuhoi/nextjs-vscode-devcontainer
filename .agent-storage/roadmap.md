# Agent Storage Roadmap

This file lives in `.agent-storage/roadmap.md` and is the single source of truth for
planned agent features. Each bullet represents a feature or task that an AI agent can
work on. When a feature is complete, the agent should strike it through or add a checkmark.

Example:

- [ ] browse-products
- [ ] implement-instrumentation

Each feature gets its own directory under `.agent-storage` (see below).
